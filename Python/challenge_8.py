Challenge 8 - Days Alive Calculator:

Here is a cool program that calculates your age in
days/hours/minutes/seconds.
'''

name = input("What is your name?\n") # ask user for his name
age = int(input("What is your age?\n")) # ask user for his age

days_alive = 365 * age
print("you have been alive for: " + days_alive + " days")

age_in_hours = 24 * number_of_days_lived_for
print("age in hours: " + age_in_hours)

age_minutes = 60 * age_in_hours
print("you have been alive for: " + age_minutes + "minutes")
